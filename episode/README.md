# Episode Queries

Endpoint: https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql

This folder contains GraphQL queries that fetch episodes by ID.

Each `.graphql` file contains a query requesting:
id, name, air_date, episode

Each `-output.json` file contains the actual response returned by the GraphQL endpoint for that query.
