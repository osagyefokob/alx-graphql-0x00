# Character Queries

Endpoint: https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql

This folder contains GraphQL queries used to fetch characters by ID.

Each `.graphql` file contains a query requesting:
id, name, status, species, type, gender.

Each `-output.json` file contains the actual API response for that query.
